## Review: Polar Exchange Rate 

The impossible trilemma represented one of the main constraint for Latin American countries over the past century. The experience shows that to chose a fixed exchange rate implies an important risk which is not always backed by enough gains since the national industrial promotion policies (the objective pursuited by the exchange rate policy) are not generally designed following an efficient measure but particular interests which could have not desirable effects in terms of efficiency too.

Then, the main question for me over the decision of implement or not a fixed exchange rate (and a controlled capital movement, which means an independent monetary policy) is which is the development objective behind. I'm excluding here those decisions of exchange rate and capital movements that try to prevent the effect of sudden short term changes on the foreign sector which could negatively affect the main economic indicators. The next question is: Does Colombia has a clear development policy? No. Then, my decision will be to have a free capital movement and an independent monetary policy in order to guarantee stable conditions for national and foreign investment.
